# connect4_optimization_2
 We are students in the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at The University of Texas at Austin, and we built our own Connect 4 AI application as part of a full-stack development project. Our goal was not only to create an AI that plays Connect 4 but also to train our own Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer models using unique board position data. These models enable our bot to make strategic decisions and challenge human players in an interactive web-based game.  As part of this project, we took on multiple rolesâ€”machine learning engineers, software developers, and cloud architects. We trained our AI models, containerized them using Docker, deployed them on a cloud backend, and built a front-end interface where users can play against our trained bot. This project allowed us to integrate our knowledge of deep learning, cloud computing, and web development into a single, hands-on application.  Through this experience, we gained insights into model training, deployment, and user interaction while building a competitive AI opponent for a classic strategy game.
